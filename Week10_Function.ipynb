    "#### Time complexity\n",
    "So far in this book, we have become accustomed to our programs being executed at near-instantaneous speed. However, algorithms can quickly become inefficient as problems complexify. In measuring complexity, you are interested in knowing how the time it takes to execute the algorithm changes as the size of the problem changes. If the problem is 10 times as large, does the algorithm take 10 times as long to execute, 100 times as long, or 1,000 times as long? This relationship between the size of the problem and the steps taken is called the time complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    " Common time complexities include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Any such problem where the complexity can be expressed as a linear function, α * n + β, has a time complexity of O(n).O(n) means that, for a problem of size n, the number of steps taken is proportional to n. \n",
    "* O(1)—Constant time: Here, the time taken is always the same, regardless of the problem size; for example, accessing an element of an array at a given index.\n",
    "* O(n^2)—Quadratic time: Here, the time taken is proportional to the square of the problem size; for example, the bubble sort algorithm (this is covered in Exercise 40 – using bubble sort in Python)\n",
    "* O(log n)—Logarithmic time: Here, the time taken is proportional to the natural logarithm of the problem size; for example, the binary search algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you computed the maximum of a list of positive numbers. The complexity of the algorithm was the big-O notation. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our program starts by setting the maximum = 0 variable.  For a list of size n, you are going to loop through each number and perform the following operations: (a) Check whether it’s greater than the maximum variable (b) If so, assign the maximum to the number\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, there will be one step executed for a number and, sometimes, there will be two steps (if that number happens to be the new maximum). You don’t really care what this number is, so let’s take its average, which you’ll call α. That is, for each number, there will be an average of α steps executed, where α is a number between 1 and 2.\n",
    "So, total_steps = 1 + α * n. This is a linear function, so the time complexity is O(n)."
